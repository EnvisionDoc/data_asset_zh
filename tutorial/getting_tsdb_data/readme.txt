5 - Obtaining Original and Calculated Data in TSDB

Keywords: storage policy, stream data processing, TSDB, API

Cover page description: Learn how to process original data ingested from devices, store both the origin data and calculated data in TSDB, and obtain the stored data with EnOS data service APIs.

Overview page: When your device real-time data is ingested and transmitted to the IoT hub, you may want to process the origin data first, and then store the origin data and processed data based on your business needs. The stored data can be obtained easily for future usage.

Tutorial Overview: Learn the flow of processing stream data, storing the origin and calculated data, and getting the stored data.
Unit 1: Defining a model and needed measuring points for a smart device on EnOS Console.
Unit 2: Configuring storage policies for the original data and calculated data of the device measuring points.
Unit 3. Registering the device on EnOS Console and performing device-end development to connect the device to EnOS.
Unit 4: Developing stream data processing jobs for aggregating the uploaded device data and checking the running results of data processing.
Unit 5: Programming to invoke EnOS data service APIs to get the original and calculated data stored in TSDB.
